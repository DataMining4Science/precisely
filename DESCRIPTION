Description: Estimate sample size based on precision rather than power. 
    precisely is a study planning tool to calculate sample size based on 
    precision rather than power. Power calculations are focused on whether or 
    not an estimate will be statistically significant; calculations of precision
    are based on the same principles as power calculation but turn the focus to
    the width of the confidence interval.
