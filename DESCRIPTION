Description: Estimate sample size based on precision rather than
    power. precisely is a study planning tool to calculate sample size
    based on precision rather than power. Power calculations are focused
    on whether or not an estimate will be statistically significant;
    calculations of precision are based on the same principles as power
    calculation but turn the focus to the width of the confidence
    interval.
